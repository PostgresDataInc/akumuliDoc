Sliding window is a central concept in akumuli. This is a time window in which writes are possible. If you are trying to write something before sliding window - you will get `AKU_ELATE_WRITE` error. If you are trying to write something after the sliding window (future write) - sliding window will move.

This can be a source errors, if you write data element with timestamp from a distant future, akumuli will move sliding window to that future and discard all subsequent writes with correct timestamps. This is possible because library doesn't make any asumptions about nature of timestamps provided: whether it is a real Unix timestamp or some sequence number, who knows? Because of that it can't validate timestamps. Timestamp validation is responsibility of the application, for example, application may know that timestamp is actually a Unix timestamp and compare it with current time.
