Welcome to the Akumuli wiki!

Akumuli is a time-series database with it's own unique storage engine, designed specifically for time-series data. Akumuli database consists of two parts - server application and storage engine. At this moment only storage engine is implemented and documented. This storage engine can be used without server application as an embedded database engine (like sqlite).
