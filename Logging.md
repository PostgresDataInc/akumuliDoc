Akumuli doesn't depends on any logger. Instead of that it allows user to use the same logger as host application. Callback function can be passed to library that will be used to log messages. Callback signature: `void (int tag, const char* message)`. First parameter - tag - used to distinguish between multiple opend databases. If message doesn't correspond to any opend database tag will be zero. If user doesn't supplied this callback - default mechanism will be used, all messages will be written to stderr.
